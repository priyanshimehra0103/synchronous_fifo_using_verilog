## ðŸ“Œ What is a Synchronous FIFO?  
A **Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer** is a type of memory queue where data is written and read using the same clock signal. It follows the FIFO principle, meaning the first data written is the first data read.

## ðŸ”¹ Why is it Used?  
- **Data Buffering** â†’ Stores data temporarily to handle speed differences between producer and consumer.  
- **Pipeline Stages** â†’ Helps in smooth data transfer between processing units.  
- **Flow Control** â†’ Uses **full** and **empty** flags to prevent data loss.  
- **Clock Synchronization** â†’ Ensures reliable data transfer in a **single clock domain**.  

This project implements a **32-bit width, 8-entry depth synchronous FIFO** using **SystemVerilog**, along with a testbench for simulation and verification.
